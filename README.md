# TB Deaths - Exploratory Data Analysis using Python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step of the data analytics process. It involves exploring the data and identifying important features about the data as well as asking interesting questions from the data by using statistical and visualization tools studied in earlier classes such as descriptive statistics and basic plotting. Entire aim of exploratory data analysis is to be able to get familiar with the data, perform data munging and manipulation, and ask questions before trying to forecast and run Machine Learning models on the data.

Dataset: In the first example, the dataset that I consider is data on countries and their territories. Specifically, I would using data files for TB Deaths, spread of TB, and number of new cases of TB to answer some important questions.

In any data analysis process, there is one or more questions I want to answer. That is the most basic and important step in the whole process, to define these questions. Since I am going to perform some Exploratory Data Analysis in our TB dataset, these are the questions I want to answer:

Which are the countries with the highest and infectious TB incidence?

What is the general world tendency in the period from 1990 to 2007?

What countries don't follow that tendency?

What other facts about the disease do we know that we can check with our data?
